Odesa
This Southern city has a lot of nicknames. ‘The Sea pearl of Ukraine’ is, perhaps, the most popular one. And Odesa (not Odessa!) shines — day and night! 

Here you’ll find 19th century architecture rubbing shoulders with a unique urban city flavor. Talented sense of humor trenches here upon the real everyday wisdom. For starters, visit ‘Privoz’ which is the main city market. Go to the fish stall or the old shopping stalls, and be ready to listen, see and remember.

To experience the real Odesa you should walk along its unique yards which are located in the historical centre and in the Moldavanka district. As most of the houses in the city center had been built before the revolution, almost all of Odesa’s yards are two — or three-storied, closed and picturesque. 

A well developed gastro tourism scene, fantastic fresh seafood, never-ending night life that attracts people from all over the world (check out the Arcadia district), waterfronts, beaches in and around the city — you will definitely fall in love with Odesa. You have absolutely no choice!
